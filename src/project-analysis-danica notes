What I understand about the project:
-App.css attributes to the styling in the REACT Applications
-the concept of e.target.value
    - In the event, it is meant to get exactly what you inputed in the input box 
- Elements needed for list portion: make sure it does not refresh everytime you add tast, 
each task has a random number(to distinguish it)and is false, after you press enter the state goes 
back to zero 
- what each javascript tab is meant for 
    -Form.js:where you input your task & where you can find the drop down of which tasks are 
    completed and not completed and all
    -TodoList.js:renders out text with console.log 
    -Todo.js: where you can delete and complete todos
    -App.js: where alot of the states are, these states aadd functionality to the todos the user implements to 
    REACT 
        -also filters out todos, so all todos have a status and can be seen
What I do not understand about the project:
-fas fa-plus-square <-- whatever this thing is 
    - I think it creates a visual for the person to see (not sure tho)
        - this creates a square 
- the concept of JSON and why is it implemented in the saveLocaltodos declaration
-the way certain segments of code are grouped and ordered 
    -I get it, but also don't (it just takes me a while to make it all connect in my brain)
What I think can be improved:
-avoid always looking at a referense sheet for the terminal
    - this will save time
- be more organize with my extra comments
    -I tend to forget if a comment relates to the line above or below, so I should definately fix that to avoid 
    confusion
